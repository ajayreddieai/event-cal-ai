const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",

### How It Works:

1. **Event Fetching**: GitHub Actions runs `scripts/fetch-events.mjs` every 6 hours
2. **Data Storage**: Events are saved to `data/events.json` and committed to the repo
3. **Static Generation**: Next.js builds a static site that reads from the JSON file
4. **Deployment**: GitHub Pages serves the static files with automatic updates
